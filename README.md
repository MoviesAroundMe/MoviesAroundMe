# MoviesAroundMe
* MVP: Choose from 3 movies, get reviews and ratings
* Testing with: Rspec/Capybara

## To run our app:
* Run `bundle install`
* `brew install phantomjs` (Gemfile?)
* `gem install rackup` (Does not work in the gemfile?)



# Problems/Ideas:
* Additional options that we have not used: rotten tomatoes user rating and fresh/rotten data

# Potential additional features:
* Facebook log in, see what movies/cinemas your friends like or having something to say about.

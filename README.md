# MoviesAroundMe
* MVP: Choose from 3 movies, get reviews and ratings
* Testing with: Rspec/Capybara


# Problems/Ideas:
* Do we use the Cineworld API or scrape Google results?
* Additional options that we have not used: rotten tomatoes user rating and fresh/rotten data

# Potential additional features:
* Facebook log in, see what movies/cinemas your friends like or having something to say about.
